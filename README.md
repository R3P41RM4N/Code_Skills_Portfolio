# Code Skills Portfolio for Jon H. aka R3p41rm4n

#### Greetings all and Welcome to my coding skills portfolio! I built this repository as a professional portfolio geared at my self-development activities. As a Offensive Cybersecurity Professional, while it is not necessary to code in this field, I believe it is an important skill set that can help you find efficiencies in your job. 

### Target Languages: Python, Rust, C, Assembly_X86/X86_64/ARM, 

### I am currently working on: Python Skills to improve my understanding and baseline knowledge in preparation for OSWE in Fall 2023.
### Current Resource: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ by Al Sweigart.
#### Narrative: Al Swigart presents the material in a way that you can apply lessons learned immediately. Additionally he is a big fan of putting his material on the web, so almost all of his books are posted under a "creative commons" license. Go check it out!
